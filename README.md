# P1CG4--Smoxy-

Current code in Jonathan Branch

Step 1 : Create a folder and virtual environment venv
Step 2 : Place all the files and folder in
Step 3 : pip install all missing dependencies

App.py is the entry file, run that.
mitmproxy and flask both uses ports, they can be changed in the app.py under mitm_port and flask_port.

Feel free to ask moi for any issue
